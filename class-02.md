 chapter 2 text 
  in html  we have 2 type of tages 
  strucatual markup that we use it to describwe headin g and patggraph and semantic  we use it  to provide extra info 
  we have from h1 to h6 for heeading h1 is the biggest 
   if we want to write pargraphe we use the <p> tag 
   if we want to make the font italic we use <i> and close it with </i> and for bold we use <b>
 and we have <sub> and</sub> <sup> if we </sup> have a text we want to write it above or under lines
   if we leave many white space in our text in html  it will  consdier it as one whitespace 
   <br/> for breadk and go to an ew line 
   <hr/> to make a horzinta line between elements 
   There are some text elements that are not intended to affect the
structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the
pages â€” they are known as semantic markup. and we call it semantic  tags or elements like 
 <strong> to make the text bold </strong>
 and <em> to make</em> it emmizeise 
 <cite>
When you are referencing a piece of work such as a book,film or researchpaper, the<cite> element can be used to indicate where the citation is from.
<dfn> is for defination we i have to explain something 
<address> it`s contain contact details for the author of the page 
 <ins> to put underline  </ins>for a work 
 and  <del> to delate </del>this word with a line in the center of it 
<s> when we want to talk about some thing is not truely accorate 
## chapter 10 inrada to css 
if we want to understand the css think of it like its a box and we are controil it with some rules that we put it 
css rule containes 2 parts : 1-selctor it`s tells us which elents are we contoling
 and declation  tells us what the propraty we want to give it to the sleector we choosie it 
  and now im` going to talk about some slectors 
  forst universial selector  app;ayed to all elents of  the document  *[]
  and type selector  matches the elements name like h1[]
class slecerotr  matches the lements that are in the same class  .note[]
 id slector and we talk about it before 
 child selector that it`s match a child of the parent element like this li>a {}
 why we use extranl sheets for srtyling 
 bec if the same style we want it to many pages it`s doesnt make seinice to write it in every page so we make it extranl and use it for all the pages 
 and it`s helps me making changes 
 chapter 2 
 ## Basic JavaScript Instructions
 and just like the css we can make the script internal or extranl 
 the only way to  use methods  is using objects 
 a script is a series of instractions thta the comupter do it to accomplish the goal and each  instration is known as statement  and should end up with a semicolon 
 java script  it case senstive thta`s mean the var A is drfirent from var a 
 we use  comments to explain what the code does  and to make the code easier we use doubal forwordslash  for a single line comment and we use forwordslash fallowed by star  to to multi lines comments 
 the varible is where we store the data we need 
 declaringa varbible is to create a varbible and give it a vaule like this 
 var name=muna;
  for the data tpyes we have numeric  thaat hangel numbers and string handles letters aND OTHER CHARACHTOR  and booleAN IT`S TRUE OR FALSE 
     THIER IS 6 RULES WE HAVE TO FLLOW IT  to give a name for a varbible 
     1- the name must begines with letter or $ or _ and it`s have to start with a number 
     2- the name can containes numbers or $ or _ but not -or .
     3-we can`t use the keresved words from javascript like print or var or any keyword s as a varbile name
     4-case senstive 
     5-we have to use a name that describe the useage of it like we use width instide of x for the width of something 
     6-if the vatbile name made up from more than one words make the first charactor of every word capital letter 
     ## arrays :
     is a spiceal type if varible it stores a list of values 
     we can acess the items of the list by using the index and it`s starts from 0 not 1 
     # expression evalutes to a resualt  as a sin gle value like adding 2 numbers and store it in a new var 
     when we have a+b=c we call the hole thing expression and the puls sign we call it operator

    decison making :
    theere are often serverl places in a script that  where a decion will make change and decide which line will be extucted 
    there are 2 componet to a decison : 
    1-an expression is evaluated which return  a value 
    2-a condatinal statemant say  what to do if we have this stuation 
    logical opeatroe only retun a single value (true or false  and it`s allow us to compare the reualst to ather opradner )
    if statement evaluates a condation like this 
    if(condation){
        here are the steps we put it if the condation is true 
    }
    and we can add else to the if statemant and we put in it if code that will be ecteted if the condaton is flase
