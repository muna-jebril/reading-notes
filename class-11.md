EASILY CREATE STUNNING ANIMATED CHARTS WITH CHART.JS
chart  are a better way than the table to display the data 
<canvas> it`s just like img but it doesnt have the src or the alt it has  width and hieght 
we can style the canvas just like any pic by using the margin and the padding and so on 
The <canvas> element differs from an <img> tag in that, like for <video>, <audio>, or <picture> elements so we should provide a fallback conent for it
