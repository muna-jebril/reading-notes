HTML  book chapter 1 
So today we are going to talk about  html 
 How people  access the  web ? 
1.	Browerse: people access websites using  web browers like chrome and firefox .
2.	Web server :  when we ask the brower to show us a page the brower show us a page the request is  send to a spiceal computer called server  
When you visit a website, the web server
hosting that site could be anywhere in the
world. In order for you to find the location of
the web server, your browser will first connect
to a Domain Name System (DNS) server. 
How the web works >
  1- when we connect with the web we do it using ISP (internet serviver provider) and then we type the domian name or the web adress 
   2- then  our computer will contact with the DNS and will give it the ip address for this domian name  and the ip address consstes of 12 digits and every  device  have a unieq ip address
    then the ip address allows us to contact with this website 
    The web server then sends the
page you requested back to your
web browser.
  so tages in html is like a container and  inside the tag we put the contant   weh ave <h1>  to <h6> and <p> and   <html > and <body> and a lots if tages that we are going to talk aboyut it later 
   and we have to close our tages by using  backslash   like this <p> </p> 
   and we are going to talk about attribute that we use it to give more info abouyt the content and we have put the value of the attribute in doble qution  like this 
   <p lang= "en-us">
    inside the body we put everything we wants we put things that we want it to be display on the web browers  
    and inside the head we put the metadeta (the deta that doesnt show to the user but it`s for our selfs  and for responsive attacts)
     the tittle we put it inside the head and the tittle display the  tittle if  our page inside the tab 
      ## extra markup  
      because we have many version of html  we have to  use the tag doctype like this <!DOCTYPE html> this indcaites that we are using html 5 
       when we want to make notes or comment   in html so we use <!-- -->  any thing insdie it it will not be showen to the  user it just memoes for you as a programer 

       ID Attribute:  we use the id attrubute for soem tages that we  want to give it a unieq id and we will use the id  with styling  . <h1 id="heading"> 
       we can use the class atturbuite  and we can  have  more than one emlemnt in the same class so if we have some  elents and we want to give it the same style we can  put in in a class with the same name and then style  by the class name   <p class= "ggg">
         

         block element:
         Some elements will alwaysappear to start on a new line inthe browser window. These are known as block level elements. like  h1 ,p, ul ,li 
         inline ements :the elemetns thats apper to  contuiune on the same line like <em> <img>
           the div allows us to  set a diffrent type of elents inside a block  it called div  
           escape  charactors :
           so if we want to use some charactors that  we use it with html we have to use the escape charactor to print it 
           Less-than sign like :&lt; or &#60;
