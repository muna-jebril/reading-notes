## chapter 3 list 
we have 3 types of list
1-ordered list: list where the items are numberd
2-unorderd list :the list begins with with bullet points.
3-defintionlists 
we use <ol> <li> here where we put the items </ol> for orderd list 
for unorderd list we use <ul> <li></ul>
<dl> </dl> this element  constist of a series of trems and their defination and inside this tag we will see <dt></dt> it contains the trems being difned 
and we have <dd> </dd> This is used to contain the
definition.
we can use nestd lists inside each other    
 ## chapter 13 boxes
  when we  talk about boxes  we mean continer that holds things and  and we control the styling of it.
  we can spifiy the width and the height of the box using px or cm or other units 
  we use min-width, max-width to spicefy the minmem and the maxiam width of the page  it`s helpful when we egible the page 
   ## overFlow
   the overflow  tells the browers what to do  if the content is bigger than the size if the box 
   scroll
This property adds a scrollbar to
the box so that users can scroll
to see the missing content
every box have propertiers that helps us to control the apperance 
1-border:The border
separates the edge of one box
from another.
2-margin gap between the borders of two
adjacent boxes.
3-padding:Padding is the space between
the border of a box and any
content contained within it.
the padding and thew margin  helps us making spaces betweent items 
in  margin if we want to make the tet in the center we can make  the margin-left and margin-right to auto 
It is possible to hide elements using the display and
visibility properties.
## chapter 4 in javascript 
we are talking about the switch statement 
we use  the swich statement when we have multiple cases we can use the if else but it`s anthor way to do it first we have the swich value  it`s the condation of the statemnt and then we have the cases listed and at the end of each case we put break and we have a default: that if it`s non of the above it will go to the default 
the main diffrent betweent if else statemtn and swich that in if else if it find the answer it will loop for the other condation unlike the switch if it find it it will break 
##TYPE COERCION and WEAK TYPING
so if we missuse the var type the javascript will corret it for us like if we have a string 1 it will convert it to a number 1 
true and false in boolen it mean either 0 or 1 
## loops
 loops check a cndation if it`s true ot will extucte the code and if it false their is anther block will extected 
 we have 1-for : if we now how many time we will run this code 
 2-while if we dont know the   numbers of time a and it will end when the condation if false 
 3-do while  it will allways  run the statemtn at least one then will check if the condation is true or false 
 and we have a c ounter for the statements above 
 like this for example :
 for (i=0; i>10; i++)
